For fun I made a really simplified version of that game where you ski left and right to dodge obstacles in the console.

The game mainly runs in the console, and uses console graphics. Later I decided to add SFML graphics library for input detection and to display a little graphics window.

Keys: Left, Right, Down arrows: Change direction/start game

Originally in the console the '|' character was meant to denote the player on a snowboard, and the 'T's are trees to dodge. In the graphical window I used some simple sprites, but turned the player into a snail and the trees into rocks.
